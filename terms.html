            <h1>Featured ads</h1>
            <p>Taswiq4u may offer a service known as “featured ads” where users may pay a non-refundable fee to have
                their ads posted in selected locations on the website, thus potentially increasing an ads’ visibility.
                In order to purchase a featured ad, you may be required to transmit certain information through a
                third-party service provider, including but not limited to a third-party payment service provider, which
                may be governed by its own terms of use and other policies. Taswiq4u makes no representation or
                guarantee as to the safety or security of the information transmitted to any third-party service
                provider, and your linking to any third-party service is completely at your own risk, and taswiq4u
                disclaims all liability related thereto.</p>
